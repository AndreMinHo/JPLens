# RECOMMENDED: Internal URLs for better performance (http:// protocol added automatically)
JPLENS_CONTEXT_URL=jplens-context.railway.internal
JPLENS_AI_CONTEXT_URL=jplens-ai-context.railway.internal

# ALTERNATIVE: Public URLs (use if internal networking doesn't work)
# JPLENS_CONTEXT_URL=https://jplenscontext-production.up.railway.app
# JPLENS_AI_CONTEXT_URL=https://jplensaicontext-production.up.railway.app

# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# 1. Check Railway dashboard for exact service names
# 2. Ensure all services are in the same Railway project
# 3. Internal URLs use HTTP (not HTTPS)
# 4. Check Railway logs for connection errors

# Port (automatically set by Railway)
