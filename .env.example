# Railway Environment Variables for JPLens Master App

# RECOMMENDED: Internal URLs for better performance 
# IMPORTANT: Railway internal URLs MUST include the port number!
# Use the PORT that each backend service is listening on (check their logs/code)
JPLENS_CONTEXT_URL=http//:<JPLENS_CONTEXT_INTERNAL_URL>:PORT
JPLENS_AI_CONTEXT_URL=http//:<JPLENS_AI_CONTEXT_INTERNAL_URL>:PORT

# ALTERNATIVE: Public URLs (use if internal networking doesn't work)
# JPLENS_CONTEXT_URL=https://jplenscontext-production.up.railway.app
# JPLENS_AI_CONTEXT_URL=https://jplensaicontext-production.up.railway.app

# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# 1. Check Railway dashboard for exact service names (look at the "Settings" tab)
# 2. Ensure all services are in the same Railway project
# 3. Internal URLs MUST use format: http://servicename.railway.internal:PORT
# 4. Check each backend service's logs to confirm what PORT they're listening on
# 5. Common ports: 8000, 8001, 3000, 5000, etc.
# 6. Internal URLs use HTTP (not HTTPS)

# Port (automatically set by Railway)
PORT=3000
